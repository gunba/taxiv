Broadly, the effective life of a depreciating asset is the period it can be used to produce income. The decline in value is based on the cost and effective life of the depreciating asset, not its actual change in value. It begins at start time, when you begin to use the asset (or when you have it installed ready for use). It continues while you use the asset (or have it installed). Usually, the owner of a depreciating asset holds the asset and can therefore claim deductions for its decline in value. Sometimes the economic owner will be different to the legal owner and the economic owner will be the holder. | Subdivision 40-B |\n| 1.2 | Cost The cost of a depreciating asset includes both: expenses you incur to start holding the asset; and additional expenses that contribute to its present condition and location (e.g. improvements). | Subdivision 40-C |\n| 1.3 | Balancing adjustments When you stop holding a depreciating asset you may have to include an amount in your assessable income, or deduct an amount under a balancing adjustment. The adjustment reconciles the decline with the actual change in value. | Subdivision 40-D |\n| 1.4 | Low-value and software development pools Low-cost assets and assets depreciated to a low value may be placed in a low value pool, which is treated as a single depreciating asset. You can also pool in-house software expenditure in a software development pool. | Subdivision 40-E |\n| 1.5 | Primary production depreciating assets You can deduct amounts for capital expenditure on: water facilities immediately; or horticultural plants over a period that relates to the effective life of the plant; or fodder storage assets immediately; or fencing assets immediately. | Subdivision 40-F |\n| 2 | Rules about other capital expenditure |  |\n| 2.1 | Capital expenditure of primary producers and other landholders You can deduct amounts for capital expenditure on: landcare operations immediately; or electricity and telephone lines over 10 income years. | Subdivision 40-G |\n| 2.2 | Capital expenditure that is immediately deductible You can get an immediate deduction for certain capital expenditure on: exploration or prospecting; and rehabilitation of mine and quarry sites; and paying petroleum taxes; and environmental protection activities. | Subdivision 40-H |\n| 2.3 | Capital expenditure that is deductible over time You can deduct amounts for certain capital expenditure associated with projects you carry on. You deduct the amount over the life of the project using a project pool. You can also deduct amounts for certain business related costs over 5 years where the amounts are not otherwise taken into account and are not denied a deduction. | Subdivision 40-I |\n| 2.4 | Capital expenditure for establishing trees in carbon sink forests You can deduct amounts for capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests. | Subdivision 40-J |",

As lessee, item 1 makes Rachael the holder of the car. Power, as the legal owner, would normally hold the car under item 10._\n\n_However, item 1 makes it clear that Power, as lessor, does not hold the car. As the lessee, item 1 would normally mean that Kris held the car but, again, she is also a lessor and so is not the holder (she also doesn’t have the right to use the car during the sublease)._\n\n_Example 2:\tSandra sells a packing machine to Jenny under a hire purchase agreement. Jenny holds the machine under item 6 because, although she is not the legal owner until she exercises her option to purchase, she possesses the machine now and can exercise an option to become its legal owner._\n\n_Jenny is reasonably expected to exercise that option because the final payment will be well below the expected market value of the machine at the end of the agreement. Sandra, as the machine’s legal owner, would normally be its holder under item 10 but item 6 makes it clear that the legal owner is not the holder._\n\n_Note 1:\tSome assets may have holders under more than one item in the table._\n\n_Note 2:\tAs well as hire purchase agreements, items 5 and 6 cover cases like assets subject to chattel mortgages, sales subject to retention of title clauses and assets subject to bare trusts._",

The medals have a market value of $20,000. The machine has an arm’s length value of $100,000 but Gold Medals has to contribute $75,000 towards acquiring it from the association. Gold Medals will have to include:_\n\n\n[Image Description: Start formula open bracket $100,000 minus $75,000 close bracket equals $25,000 end formula]\n\n_in its assessable income because of section 21A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936._\n\n_The first element of the machine’s cost will be the greater of:_\n\n_•\tthe amount it paid ($75,000) plus the market value of the non-cash benefits it provided ($20,000), which comes to $95,000; and_\n\n_•\tthe amount that was assessable income from receiving the machine ($25,000) plus the amount by which that assessable income was reduced because of the payment Gold Medals made ($75,000), which comes to $100,000._\n\n_So, in this case, the first element of the machine’s cost to Gold Medals is $100,000._\n\n_Example 2:\tLaura travels overseas to purchase a purpose-built vehicle for use in her trade. The purchase of the vehicle is the sole reason for the trip. Laura incurs expenses for airfares and accommodation. These expenses are included in the cost of the vehicle because they are “in relation to starting to hold” the vehicle._\n\n\n| Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating asset or to receive a benefit | Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating asset or to receive a benefit | Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating asset or to receive a benefit |\n|---|---|---|\n| Item | In this case: | The amount is: |\n| 1 | You pay an amount | The amount |\n| 2 | You incur or increase a liability to pay an amount | The amount of the liability or increase when you incurred or increased it |\n| 3 | All or part of a liability to pay an amount owed to you by another entity is terminated | The amount of the liability or part when it is terminated |\n| 4 | You provide a *non-cash benefit | The *market value of the non-cash benefit when it is provided |\n| 5 | You incur or increase a liability to provide a *non-cash benefit | The *market value of the non-cash benefit or the increase when you incurred or increased the liability |\n| 6 | All or part of a liability to provide a *non-cash benefit (except the *depreciating asset) owed to you by another entity is terminated | The *market value of the non-cash benefit when the liability is terminated |\n\n_Note 1:\tItem 1 includes not only amounts actually paid but also amounts taken to have been paid. Examples include the price of the notional purchase made when trading stock is converted to a depreciating asset under section 70-110, the cost of an asset held under a hire purchase arrangement under section 240-25 and a lessor’s deemed purchase price when a luxury car lease ends under subsection 242-90(3)._\n\n_Note 2:\tSection 230-505 provides special rules for working out the amount of consideration for an asset if the asset is a Division 230 financial arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in that consideration._\n\n(2)\tIn applying the table in subsection (1) to a liability of yours to pay an amount or provide a *non-cash benefit, don’t count any part of the liability you have already satisfied.",
