The result is the first element of the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the asset.\n\n_Example:\tWellbeing Health demutualises on 1 April 2008 and has a market value of $400 million on that day. It distributes its accumulated mutual surplus in the form of rights to acquire shares in its holding company Healthiness Insurance Ltd (Healthiness). The rights do not have an exercise price._\n\n_A total of 800 million shares can be acquired in Healthiness under rights issued under the demutualisation. Each right allows the holder to acquire 50 shares. No shares in Healthiness are issued._\n\n_Under the method statement, the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of each right is worked out by dividing the market value of Wellbeing Health (step 1) by the number of shares in Healthiness that can be acquired under the demutualisation (step 2) and multiplying the result by the number of shares that can be acquired under the right (step 4):_\n\n\n[Image Description: Start formula start fraction $400 million over 800 million end fraction times 50 equals $25 end formula]\n\n*Acquisition rule*\n\n(3)\tThe participating policy holder or trustee is taken to have *acquired the *CGT asset at the time it is issued.",

You must make the estimate for the income year in which you start to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for such a purpose.\n\n(3)\tThe taxable purpose proportion of a *depreciating asset’s *adjustable value, or of an amount included in the second element of its *cost, is that part of that amount that represents:\n\n(a)\tthe proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); or\n\n(b)\tif you have had to make an adjustment under section 328-225 for the asset—the proportion most recently applicable to the asset under that section.\n\n_Note:\tAn amount included in the second element of the cost of a depreciating asset is referred to in this Division as a cost addition amount: see subsection 328-190(3)._\n\n(4)\tThe taxable purpose proportion of a *depreciating asset’s *termination value is that part of that amount that represents:\n\n(a)\tif you have not had to make an adjustment under section 328-225 for the asset—the proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); or\n\n(b)\tif you have had to make at least one such adjustment—the average of:\n\n(i)\tthe proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); and\n\n(ii)\tthe proportion applicable to the asset for each of the 3 income years you *held the asset after the one in which the asset was allocated to the pool.\n\n_Example:\tWhen Bria’s computer was allocated to her general small business pool for the 2012-13 income year, she estimated that it would be used 50% for her florist business. Due to increasing business, Bria estimates the computer’s use to be 70% for the 2013-14 year, and 90% for the 2014-15 year. She makes an adjustment under section 328-225 for both those years._\n\n_Bria sells the computer for $1,000 at the start of the 2016-17 income year. She must now average the business use estimates for the computer for the year it was allocated to the pool and the next 3 years to work out the taxable purpose proportion of its termination value. The average is worked out as follows:_\n\n            50% (original estimate); plus\n\n            70% (2013-14 estimate); plus\n\n            90% (2014-15 estimate); plus\n\n            90% (no change on previous year);\n\n            =300% ÷ 4 = 75%\n\n_The taxable purpose proportion of the computer’s termination value is, therefore:_\n\n_75% of $1,000 = $750_",

Wombat Co, a company connected with Bilby Co, is also primarily responsible for developing a digital game. The amount worked out under subsection (1) is $15,000,000 for the income year for each company. Since the sum of these amounts exceeds $20,000,000, the companies must coordinate with one another to ensure that the amount collectively claimed stays under the $20,000,000 cap. Bilby Co and Wombat Co agree that for the income year, they will each give the Commissioner a notice specifying $10,000,000 in notices. If they both do so, each will receive an offset of $10,000,000 for the income year._\n\n(4)\tA notice given under subsection (3) by a company in relation to an income year must be given at the same time as the company claims the digital games *tax offset in its *income tax return for the income year.\n\n(5)\tA company may vary the amount specified in a notice given under subsection (3) in relation to an income year if:\n\n(a)\tin specifying the amount in the notice:\n\n(i)\tthe company made an inadvertent error in determining whether another company is a related company; and\n\n(ii)\tas a result the company did not take account of the amount of the digital games tax offset for the other company for the income year; and\n\n(b)\tthe company gives the Commissioner a notice in the *approved form specifying the varied amount.\n\nOtherwise, the notice is irrevocable.",

(In other words, your averaging component includes all of your taxable primary production income and all of your taxable non-primary production income.)\n\n(3)\tIf your taxable non-primary production income is between $5,000 and $10,000, a shading-out system applies so that your averaging component includes some of your taxable non-primary production income as well as all of your taxable primary production income.\n\n(4)\tIf your taxable non-primary production income is $10,000 or more, your averaging component equals your taxable primary production income. Your averaging component does not include any of your taxable non-primary production income.\n\n(5)\tThe following diagram shows examples of these relationships.\n\n\n[Image Description: Diagram showing averaging component as a component of basic taxable income. Column 1 shows taxable non-PP income not more than $5,000. Columns 2 and 3 show taxable non-PP income between $5,000 and $10,000.

Once that amount is repaid, the remainder is assessable when it is repaid, so that the deduction is recouped._\n\n_Example:\tMatt makes a farm management deposit of $120,000 on 1 April 2011. His taxable primary production income for the 2010—11 income year is $50,000; therefore, the deposit is only partly deductible in the year because it exceeds his taxable primary production income. Matt makes the following withdrawals from the deposit: $45,000 on 1 May 2013, $40,000 on 1 March 2014 and $35,000 on 1 September 2015._\n\n_The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first repayment of $45,000 is $50,000. No amount is included in his assessable income for the 2012-2013 income year because the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the repayment ($75,000) is less than nil._\n\n_The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the second repayment of $40,000 is $50,000. $15,000 is included in Matt’s assessable income for the 2013-2014 income year because the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the second repayment ($35,000) is $15,000, which is greater than nil._\n\n_The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the third repayment of $35,000 is $35,000; that is, $50,000 less $15,000. $35,000 is included in Matt’s assessable income for the 2015-2016 income year; that is, the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($35,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the third repayment ($0)._\n\n*Unrecouped FMD deduction*\n\n(2)\tThe unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of a *farm management deposit at a particular time is:\n\n(a)\tif no part of the deposit has been repaid before that time—the amount of the deduction under section 393-5 for making the deposit; or\n\n(b)\tif one or more parts of the deposit have been repaid before that time—the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the deposit just before the most recent such repayment, reduced by any amount included in the *owner’s assessable income under this section as a result of that repayment.\n\n_Example:\tMia makes a deposit of $3,000, all of which is deductible. The deposit’s unrecouped FMD deduction just before a first repayment of $1,000 is the amount of the deduction (that is, $3,000—see paragraph (2)(a)). The deposit’s unrecouped FMD deduction just before a second repayment is $2,000 (that is, according to paragraph (2)(b), the unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first repayment ($3,000) reduced by the $1,000 included in Mia’s assessable income as a result of the first repayment)._\n\n_Note 1:\tIf the deposit was originally an income equalisation deposit, see section 393-10 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997._\n\n_Note 1A:\tSubsection 393-16(3) affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a consolidated farm management deposit._\n\n_Note 2:\tSection 393-55 affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a new deposit linked to an old deposit affected by Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the Banking Act 1959._\n\n*Application of Division to transfer, reinvestment or other dealing*\n\n(3)\tThis Division applies to a transfer, reinvestment or other dealing with a *farm management deposit as if it were a repayment of the deposit, if:\n\n(a)\tyou are the depositor; and\n\n(b)\tthe transfer, reinvestment or other dealing is on your behalf or at your request.\n\n_Note:\tSection 393-15 modifies the application of the deduction, assessment and 12 month rules to certain transfers, reinvestments and other dealings._\n\n*Deemed repayment because of death, bankruptcy etc.*\n\n(4)\tThis section applies as if a *farm management deposit had been repaid when it became repayable, rather than when it is actually repaid, if the deposit became repayable because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 393-35 (death, bankruptcy etc.).\n\n_Note 1:\tThis means that the amount of the deposit is included in your assessable income for the income year when the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs, rather than for any later year in which the deposit might be repaid._\n\n_Note 2:\tThis also means that, under subsection 45-120(5) in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (about Pay as you go (PAYG) instalments), the amount of the deposit is included in your instalment income for the period in which the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs._\n\n_However, under section 12-140 in that Schedule, an amount may also be required to be withheld from the actual payment if you do not quote your tax file number or ABN to the relevant FMD provider._\n\n_Note 3:\tSection 393-60 of this Act may limit the operation of subsection (4) if the farm management deposit is with an ADI that becomes a declared ADI under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the Banking Act 1959._",

To avoid doubt, this Division applies in that way as if the amount transferred were the amount of the new deposit, even if that is more or less than the amount of the old deposit.\n\n_Note 1:\tThe effects of this include the following:_\n\n_(a)\tsection 393-5 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit) does not apply in relation to the making of the new deposit (see paragraphs 393-15(1)(c) and (2)(a));_\n\n_(b)\tsubsection 393-10(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit) can only apply to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 393-15(1)(c) and (2)(b));_\n\n_(c)\tsubsections 393-40(1), (2) and (4) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months) can only apply to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 393-15(1)(c) and (2)(c) and (d));_\n\n_(d)\tthe day the old deposit was made, for the purposes of subsections 393-40(1) and (2) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months) and (3A) and (4) (about repayment in the event of an applicable natural disaster), is maintained for the new deposit (see subsection 393-40(6))._\n\n_Note 2:\tAlso, the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is the same as the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit (see subsection 393-15(3)), unless subsection (6) or (7) of this section applies because the new deposit is less than the old deposit._\n\n(3)\tIn determining whether either of the following is a *farm management deposit, disregard a requirement contained in an agreement as set out in item 4 of the table in section 393-35 (requiring the deposit to be $1,000 or more):\n\n(a)\tthe new deposit;\n\n(b)\ta deposit made later directly by the transfer of the new deposit in accordance with a requirement of the relevant agreement for the new deposit as mentioned in item 13 of that table.\n\n*Unrecouped FMD deduction for new deposit less than old deposit*\n\n(6)\tDespite subsection (2) and subsection 393-15(3), if the new deposit is less than the old deposit at the time (the declaration time) the old ADI became a declared ADI under the Banking Act 1959, the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is the amount worked out using the following formula:\n\n\n[Image Description: Start formula Unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of old deposit just before declaration time times start fraction New deposit over Old deposit just before declaration time end fraction end formula]\n\n_Note:\tThe new deposit could be less than the old deposit if the entitlement is paid in instalments (each of which will be a separate new deposit)._\n\n(7)\tHowever, if the amount worked out under subsection (6) is more than the difference (if any) between:\n\n(a)\tthe *unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit just before the declaration time; and\n\n(b)\tthe total of the amounts worked out under all previous applications of subsection (6) in relation to that old deposit;\n\nthe unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is equal to the difference (if any).\n\n_Note:\tThis ensures that when new deposits linked to the old deposit are repaid, the total amount included in assessable income will not exceed the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit._\n\n*Relationship with other provisions*\n\n(8)\tThis section has effect despite Division 253 (about tax treatment of entitlements under the financial claims scheme for insolvent ADIs).",

Before creating exploration credits, the explorer must obtain an allocation of exploration credits from the Commissioner for the year. Exploration credits cannot be created for the 2025-26 income year or later income years.\n\nThe exploration credits created for an income year cannot exceed an amount based on the explorer’s greenfields minerals expenditure or tax loss for the year. If the explorer’s exploration credits allocation for the year is smaller than that amount, the amount of exploration credits that the explorer can create will be reduced to sit within the allocation. However, any unused allocation of exploration credits from the preceding year generally would be carried over and so would increase the amount of exploration credits that the explorer can create.\n\nAn exploration credit created by a greenfields minerals explorer can be issued to you if you have invested in the explorer. While the tax offset you receive for the exploration credit issued to you for an income year will apply to that income year generally, the investment that gives rise to that offset may have been made in that or the preceding income year.\n\nThere are rules to ensure that exploration credits are not streamed to some investors rather than others. There are also rules to ensure that the total of the exploration credits you receive because of an investment (whether those credits are issued to you for the year in which you invest or the subsequent year) do not exceed the corporate tax that might be paid by the greenfields minerals explorer on that investment.\n\nThe explorer is liable to pay excess exploration credit tax if the explorer issues exploration credits in breach of these rules.\n\nThere is a cap on total allocations made by the Commissioner for each income year, but if part of the cap from the preceding year is unallocated it generally will be carried over. Allocations are made in the order in which applications for an allocation are made.\n\nIf an exploration credit is issued to a corporate tax entity, it will give rise to a franking credit (rather than a tax offset).\n\n_Note:\tExcess exploration credit tax is imposed by the Excess Exploration Credit Tax Act 2015, and the amount of the tax is set out in that Act._",

The Industry Secretary will decide whether to issue the certificates. A registration can be in force for 10 income years during the period starting on 1 July 2027 and ending on 30 June 2040.\n\nThe amount of the tax offset is 10% of the company’s expenditure on these processing activities.",
