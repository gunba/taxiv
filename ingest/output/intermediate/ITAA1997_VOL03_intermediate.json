In working that out, disregard section 70-55 (about acquiring live stock by natural increase).\n\n(4)\tHowever, if you last acquired the item for no consideration, its cost is worked out using this table:\n\n\n| Cost of item acquired for no consideration | Cost of item acquired for no consideration | Cost of item acquired for no consideration |\n|---|---|---|\n| Item | In this case: | The cost is: |\n| 1 | you acquired the item during or after the 1998-99 income year, and the acquisition involved a *CGT event | the item’s *market value when you last acquired it |\n| 2 | you acquired the item before or during the 1997-98 income year, and the acquisition involved a disposal of the item to you within the meaning of former Part IIIA (Capital gains and capital losses) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 | the item’s *market value when you last acquired it |\n| 3 | your acquisition of the item involved the item: (a)\tdevolving to you as someone’s *legal personal representative; or (b)\t*passing to you as a beneficiary in someone’s estate; and, if a *CGT event had happened in relation to the item just before you started holding it as *trading stock, a *capital gain or *capital loss could have resulted that would have been taken into account in working out your *net capital gain or *net capital loss for the income year of the event | (a)\tif the person died during or after his or her 1998-99 income year—the dead person’s *cost base for the item just before his or her death; or (b)\tif the person died before or during his or her 1997-98 income year—the dead person’s indexed cost base (within the meaning of former Part IIIA (Capital gains and capital losses) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936) for the item just before his or her death (but worked out disregarding former section 160ZG (which affects the indexed cost base for a non-listed personal use asset) of that Act) |\n| 4 | any other case where you last acquired the item for no consideration | a nil amount |\n\n*Exceptions*\n\n(5)\tSubsection (1) does not apply if you start holding any of the following as *trading stock because they are severed from land:\n\n(a)\tstanding or growing crops;\n\n(b)\tcrop-stools;\n\n(c)\ttrees planted and tended for sale.\n\n(This does not prevent subsection (1) from applying to a severed item that you later start holding as trading stock.)\n\n(6)\tSubsection (1) does not apply if:\n\n(a)\tyou start holding an item as *trading stock; and\n\n(b)\timmediately before you started holding the item as trading stock, you *held the item as a *registered emissions unit.\n\n_Note:\tA transaction that this section treats as having occurred is disregarded for the purposes of these provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936:_\n\n_•\tsubsection 47A(10) (which treats certain benefits as dividends paid by a CFC)_\n\n_•\tparagraph 103A(3A)(c) (which affects whether a company is a public company for an income year)._",

The trustee advises that the amount comprises $50 CGT discount, $25 small business 50% reduction and $25 net income from a capital gain made by the trust._\n\n_In applying the rules in Subdivision 115-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, Claude reduces his capital gain of $100 by a $20 net capital loss from an earlier year. He then reduces the remaining $80 gain by $40 (CGT discount) and $20 (small business 50% reduction) leaving a net capital gain of $20._\n\n_In applying the rules in CGT event E4, the $100 payment is reduced by $25 (being the amount assessed under section 97 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936). It is further reduced by $50 under item 1 of the table and $5 under item 3. Claude’s non-assessable part is $20._\n\n_Effectively, CGT event E4 applies to the $20 small business 50% reduction allowed to Claude in applying Subdivision 115-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._\n\n_Note 1:\tStep 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1) (see table item 1) reduces by 50% the trust’s discount capital gains remaining after applying capital losses and earlier net capital losses. That 50% is excluded from the trust’s net capital gain._\n\n_Note 2:\tSubdivision 152-C (small business 50% reduction—see table items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) reduces by 50% the trust’s capital gains or discount capital gains remaining after applying step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1). That 50% is also excluded from the trust’s net capital gain._\n\n_Note 3:\tParagraph 115-215(3)(b) or (c) (see table items 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) treats a beneficiary as having an extra capital gain if an amount of the trust’s net income that is included in the beneficiary’s assessable income is attributable to trust gains that were reduced by step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1) and/or the small business 50% reduction._\n\n(5)\tA chain of trusts consists of 2 or more trusts where at least one of these conditions is satisfied for each of the trusts:\n\n(a)\tthe trustee of the trust owns units or interests in another of the trusts; or\n\n(b)\tthe trustee of another of the trusts owns units or interests in the trust.\n\n(6)\tItem 7 of the table in subsection (4) does not apply if the entity making the payment is a *managed investment trust.",

The company is the head entity of a demerger group. As part of a demerger, she receives new interests in a demerged entity. The demerged entity then lists in its own right._\n\n_Since the head entity was listed for only 3 years, the demerged entity must remain listed for 2 years before Louise’s new interests become eligible for the exception from CGT event K6._\n\n(9B)\tParagraph (9)(b) applies to a case where:\n\n(a)\tthe trust referred to in subsection (2) is a *demerged entity and a unit trust; and\n\n(b)\tunits in the demerged entity do not satisfy the test referred to in that paragraph; and\n\n(c)\tthe demerger happened not more than 5 years before the other CGT event happened;\n\nas if units in the demerged entity were listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange in Australia or a foreign country, or were ordinarily available to the public for subscription or purchase, at all times when some of the units in the *head entity of the *demerger group were so listed or available.\n\n(10)\tA *capital gain is disregarded for a *share in a company or an interest in a trust to the extent that, had you *acquired it on or after 20 September 1985, you could have chosen a roll-over for the other *CGT event under Subdivision 124-M (scrip for scrip roll-over).\n\n_Example:\tBill owns a unit in a trust that he acquired before 20 September 1985. He exchanges the unit for a unit in another trust worth $60 and $40 cash. He makes a capital gain of $50 because of CGT event K6._\n\n_Had the unit been acquired after 20 September 1985, Bill would have been entitled to a partial roll-over of the capital gain under Subdivision 124-M to the extent that his capital proceeds constituted a replacement unit._\n\n_Bill can therefore disregard 60/100 of the $50 gain ($30). The cost base of Bill’s replacement unit is reduced by this amount. Bill must include the remaining $20 of the CGT event K6 gain in the calculation of his net capital gain or loss for the year._\n\n_Note:\tA capital gain or loss made by a demerging entity from CGT event K6 happening as a result of a demerger is also disregarded: see section 125-155._",

Each partner’s capital gain or loss is calculated by allocating an appropriate share of the capital proceeds from the event and the incidental costs that relate to the event (according to the partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement)._\n\n            _Example 2:\tHelen and Clare set up a business in partnership. Helen contributes a block of land to the partnership capital. Their partnership agreement recognises that Helen has a 75% interest in the land and Clare 25%. The agreement is silent as to their interests in other assets and profit sharing._\n\n            _When the land is sold, Helen’s capital gain or loss will be determined on the basis of her 75% interest. For other partnership assets, Helen’s gain or loss will be determined on the basis of her 50% interest (under the relevant Partnership Act)._\n\n(2)\tEach partner has a separate *cost base and *reduced cost base for the partner’s interest in each *CGT asset of the partnership.\n\n(3)\tIf a partner leaves a partnership, a remaining partner *acquires a separate *CGT asset to the extent that the remaining partner acquires a share of the departing partner’s interest in a partnership asset.\n\n            _Note:\tThe remaining partners would not be affected if the departing partner sells its interests to an entity that was not a partner._\n\n            _Example:\t(Indexation is ignored for the purpose of this example)._\n\n            _John, Wil and Patricia form a partnership (in equal shares)._\n\n            _John contributes a building (which is a pre-20 September 1985 asset) having a market value of $200,000. Wil and Patricia contribute $200,000 each in cash._\n\n            _The partnership buys another asset for $400,000._\n\n            _John is taken to have disposed of 2/3 of his interest in the building (1/3 to Wil and 1/3 to Patricia). His remaining 1/3 share in the building remains a pre-CGT asset. The 1/3 shares that Wil and Patricia acquire are post-CGT assets._\n\n            _Wil retires from the partnership when the partnership assets have a market value of $1,200,000 ($500,000 for the building and $700,000 for the other asset). John and Patricia pay Wil $400,000 for his interest in the partnership._\n\n            _Wil has a capital gain of $100,000 on the building and $100,000 on the other asset. John and Patricia each acquire an additional 1/6 interest in the partnership assets. These additional interests are separate assets and post-CGT assets._\n\n(4)\tIf a new partner is admitted to a partnership:\n\n        (a)\tthe new partner *acquires a share (according to the partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement) of each partnership asset; and\n\n        (b)\tthe existing partners are treated as having *disposed of part of their interest in each partnership asset to the extent that the new partner has acquired it.\n\n            _Example:\t(Indexation is ignored for the purpose of this example)._\n\n            _Lyn and Barry form a partnership, each contributing $15,000 to its capital. The partnership buys land for $30,000._\n\n            _The land increases in value to $300,000._\n\n            _Andrew is admitted as an equal partner, paying Lyn and Barry $50,000 each to acquire a 1/3 share in the land. His cost base is $100,000._\n\n            _Lyn and Barry have each disposed of 1/3 of their interest in the land. Each has a cost base for that interest of $5,000, and capital proceeds of $50,000, leaving them with a capital gain of $45,000 each on Andrew’s admission to the partnership._\n\n            _The land is sold for its market value._\n\n            _Andrew has no capital gain on the land._\n\n            _Lyn and Barry have disposed of their remaining 2/3 original interest in the land for capital proceeds of $100,000, leaving each of them with a capital gain of:_\n\n\n[Image Description: Start formula $100,000 minus open bracket $15,000 minus $5,000 close bracket equals $90,000 end formula]",

Later, you sell the boat for $150,000._\n\n_If the cost base of the improvement in the sale year is $41,000 and the improvement threshold for that year is $96,000, the improvement will not be treated as a separate asset._\n\n_Note 1:\tSection 108-80 sets out the factors for deciding whether capital improvements are related to each other._\n\n_Note 2:\tIf the improvement is a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the event must be apportioned between the original asset and the improvement: see section 116-40._\n\n*Related improvements to pre-CGT assets*\n\n(3)\tCapital improvements to a *CGT asset (the original asset) that you *acquired before 20 September 1985 that are related to each other are taken to be a separate *CGT asset if the total of their *cost bases (assuming each one were a separate CGT asset) when a *CGT event happens in relation to the original asset is:\n\n(a)\tmore than the *improvement threshold for the income year in which the event happened; and\n\n(b)\tmore than 5% of the *capital proceeds from the event.\n\n_Note:\tIf the improvements are a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the event must be apportioned between the original asset and the improvements: see section 116-40._\n\n*Some improvements not relevant*\n\n(4)\tThis section does not apply to a capital improvement:\n\n(a)\tthat took place under a contract that you entered into before 20 September 1985; or\n\n(b)\tif there is no contract—that started or occurred before that day.\n\n(5)\tSubsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the capital improvement is made to:\n\n(a)\ta *Crown lease; or\n\n(b)\ta *prospecting entitlement or *mining entitlement; or\n\n(c)\ta *statutory licence; or\n\n(d)\ta *depreciating asset to which Subdivision 124-K applies.\n\n_Note:\tSection 108-75 deals with this situation._\n\n(6)\tThis section does not apply to a capital improvement consisting of repairs to or restoration of a *CGT asset *acquired before 20 September 1985 in circumstances where there is a roll-over under Subdivision 124-B.",

These affect the way indexation works.\n\n(2)\tIf a cost base modification replaces an element of the *cost base of a *CGT asset with an amount, or includes an amount in such an element, you index the element or the amount as if expenditure equal to the amount had been incurred in the *quarter in which the modification occurred.\n\n_Example:\tA trust is declared over a CGT asset (an example of CGT event E1). The first element of the cost base in the hands of the trustee is its market value. The trustee indexes that market value from the quarter in which the trust was declared._\n\n(3)\tA different rule applies if a cost base modification reduces the total *cost base of a *CGT asset.\n\nMethod statement\n\nStep 1.\tWork out the *cost base (all elements) of the asset as at the *quarter in which the modification occurred.\n\nStep 2.\tSubtract the amount of the reduction.\n\nStep 3.\tThe Step 2 amount forms a new first element of your *cost base, and is later indexed as if you had incurred expenditure equal to that amount in the *quarter in which the modification occurred.\n\n_Example:\tMargaret receives a capital payment of $1,000 for shares (an example of CGT event G1). The first element of her cost base is $10,250 (indexed to the quarter in which the payment was made) and the second element (similarly indexed) is $210. Add those amounts ($10,460) and subtract the $1,000. Her new first element of the cost base is $9,460. There are no other elements at that time._\n\n(4)\tDespite subsection (2), there are different rules for the exercise of an option or the conversion of a *convertible interest.\n\n*Exercise of options*\n\n(5)\tThe amount you paid for the option, and the amount you paid to exercise it, are indexed from the *quarter in which the liabilities to pay the amounts were incurred.\n\n_Example:\tOn 1 April 1997, Robyn grants Andrew an option to buy land she owns. The option fee is $10,000, and the option is to buy the land on 30 June 1998 for $100,000._\n\n_Andrew exercises the option and acquires the land on 30 June 1998. To work out whether there is a capital gain when Andrew disposes of the land, indexation is available if the land is disposed of 12 months or more after its acquisition._\n\n_The $10,000 option fee can be indexed from 1 April 1997 (when the liability to pay it was incurred). The $100,000 exercise price can be indexed from 30 June 1998 (when the liability to pay the price was incurred)._\n\n*Convertible interests*\n\n(6)\tIf you *acquire *shares in a company or units in a unit trust by converting a *convertible interest, the amount paid for the convertible interest, and the amount paid to convert it, are indexed from the *quarter in which the liabilities to pay the amounts were incurred.\n\n_Note:\tIf shares or units are acquired as a result of the exercise of the option or the conversion of the convertible interest, and an amount is paid to the company or trust on the shares or units after the day of acquisition, that amount is indexed from the time it is paid: see subsection 960-275(3)._",

The table in section 116-25 lists which ones may be relevant to each CGT event listed in the table.\n\n*Explanation of modifications*\n\n(2)\tThe first is a market value substitution rule. It is relevant if:\n\n•\tyou receive no capital proceeds from a CGT event; or\n\n•\tsome or all of the capital proceeds cannot be valued; or\n\n•\tyou did not deal at arm’s length with another entity in connection with the event.\n\n(3)\tThe second is an apportionment rule. It is relevant if a payment you receive in connection with a transaction relates in part only to a CGT event.\n\n_Example:\tYou sell 3 CGT assets for a total of $100,000. The $100,000 needs to be apportioned between the 3 assets._\n\n(4)\tThe third is a non-receipt rule. It is relevant if you do not receive, or are not likely to receive, some or all of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.\n\n(5)\tThe fourth is a repaid rule. It is relevant if you are required to repay some or all of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.\n\n(6)\tThe fifth is relevant only if another entity assumes a liability in connection with a CGT event.\n\n(7)\tThe sixth relates to misappropriation by an employee or agent. It is relevant if your employee or agent misappropriates all or part of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.\n\n_Note 1:\tAlso, these provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 modify capital proceeds:_\n\n_(a)\tsection 23B (undistributed FIF attribution income on disposal of an interest in a FIF);_\n\n_(b)\tsections 159GZZZF and 159GZZZG (cancellation of shares in a holding company);_\n\n_(c)\tsections 159GZZZQ and 159GZZZS (buy-backs of shares);_\n\n_(d)\tsections 401, 422, 423 and 461 (CFCs)._\n\n_Note 2:\tSection 230-505 of this Act (Division 230 financial arrangement as consideration for provision or acquisition of a thing) also modifies capital proceeds._",

(It does not matter whether the CGT event has already happened or may happen in the future.)\n\n_Note 1:\tThere are exceptions: see section 121-30._\n\n_Example 1:\tYou dispose of a CGT asset. The records that are relevant to working out your capital gain or loss are records of:_\n\n_•\tthe date you acquired the asset;_\n\n_•\tthe date you disposed of it;_\n\n_•\teach element of its cost base and reduced cost base and the effect of indexation on those elements;_\n\n_•\twhat you sold it for (the capital proceeds)._\n\n_Example 2:\tCompany A disposes of a CGT asset it acquired from company B (a member of the same wholly-owned group and a foreign resident) where company B obtained a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B. In addition to the records mentioned in example 1, company A needs records showing:_\n\n_•\tthe status of the 2 companies as members of the group;_\n\n_•\twhich company is the ultimate holding company in the group;_\n\n_•\tthe cost base and reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of company B just before the roll-over (because these become company A’s cost base and reduced cost base)._\n\n_Example 3:\tCGT event G2 (about shifts in share values) happens involving company X and Greg (a controller (for CGT purposes) of company X). Z Nominees Pty Ltd (an associate of Greg’s) suffers a material decrease in the value of its shares in company X as a result of the shift. Z Nominees needs records showing:_\n\n_•\tthe essential elements of the relevant scheme;_\n\n_•\tthe date when the share value shift occurred;_\n\n_•\tthe amounts of the decreases and increases in the market values of all shares involved in the scheme;_\n\n_•\tif shares are issued at a discount under the scheme, the amount of the discount;_\n\n_•\tthe cost bases and market values of the shares that decreased in value._\n\n_Note 2:\tThere is an administrative penalty if you do not keep records as required by this Division: see section 288-25 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953._\n\n(2)\tThe records must be in English, or be readily accessible and convertible into English. They must show what is described in this section. (They show something if they include whatever material is necessary for that thing to be easily identified or worked out.)\n\n(3)\tThey must show the nature of the act, transaction, event or circumstance, the day when it happened or arose and:\n\n(a)\tin the case of an act—who did it; and\n\n(b)\tin the case of a transaction—who were the parties to it.\n\n(4)\tThey must show details (including relevant amounts) of how the act, transaction, event or circumstance is relevant (or can reasonably be expected to be relevant) to working out whether you have made a *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event.\n\n(5)\tIf the necessary records of an act, transaction, event or circumstance do not already exist, you must reconstruct them or have someone else reconstruct them.\n\n_Example:\tYour capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event may depend on the market value of property at a particular time. To record that market value properly, you may need to get a valuation done._\n\nPenalty:\t30 penalty units.\n\n_Note:\tSee section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 for the current value of a penalty unit._\n\n(6)\tAn offence under this section is an offence of strict liability.\n\n_Note:\tFor strict liability, see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code._",
