The basic indicator of the economic character of an equity interest, on the other hand, is the contingent nature of the returns (or convertibility into an interest of that nature)._\n\n_Note 2:\tThe test is intended to operate, for example, to:_\n\n_(a)\tdeny deductibility (but allow franking) for “interest” in relation to a scheme that has the legal form of a loan if the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the relevant scheme gives the interest characteristics that are the same as or similar to those of a dividend on an ordinary share (and thereby prevent deductible returns on equity); and_\n\n_(b)\tallow a deduction (but not franking) for a “dividend” in relation to a scheme that has the legal form of an ordinary share if the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the relevant scheme gives the dividend characteristics that are the same as or similar to those of deductible interest on an ordinary loan (and thereby prevent frankable returns on debt)._\n\n_This will not happen if a provision in this Act specifically provides for a different treatment for the interest or dividend._\n\n(3)\tAnother object of this Division is that the combined effect of *related schemes be taken into account in appropriate cases:\n\n(a)\tto ensure that the test operates effectively on the basis of the economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under the schemes rather than merely on the basis of the legal form of the schemes; and\n\n(b)\tto prevent the test being circumvented by entities merely entering into a number of separate schemes instead of a single scheme.\n\n(4)\tAnother object of this Division is to identify the distributions and credits made in respect of *non-share equity interests in a company that are to be treated as *dividends (non-share dividends) and those that are to be treated as returns of capital (non-share capital returns).\n\n_Note:\tNon-share dividends will generally be included in the recipient’s assessable income and may be frankable._\n\n(5)\tThe Commissioner must have regard to the objects stated in subsections (1) to (3) in exercising the power to make a determination under any of the following provisions:\n\n(a)\tsubsection 974-15(4);\n\n(b)\tsubsection 974-60(3), (4) or (5);\n\n(c)\tsection 974-65;\n\n(d)\tsubsection 974-70(4);\n\n(e)\tsubsection 974-150(1).\n\n_Note:\tAn entity can apply to the Commissioner to have a determination made and can object under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 if it is dissatisfied with a determination (see section 974-112)._\n\n(6)\tRegulations may also be made under the provisions of this Division:\n\n(a)\tto clarify the meaning of certain words and phrases in the light of emerging commercial practices, conditions and products; and\n\n(b)\tto give guidance on the detailed operation of particular provisions.\n\nThe regulations must be consistent with the objects stated in subsections (1) to (3).\n\n(7)\tWithout limiting subsection 13(3) of the Legislation Act 2003, the regulations made for the purposes of this Division may specify different rules for different classes of circumstances.",
