The result is the *tax offset to which the entity is entitled under this section for the relevant year.\n\n_Note:\tThis method statement is modified for certain late balancing entities: see section 205-70 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997._\n\n_Example:\tThe following apply to a corporate tax entity that satisfies the residency requirement for an income year:_\n\n_•\tthe entity’s income tax liability for that year would be $100,000 if its tax offsets were disregarded;_\n\n_•\tfor that year, the entity has a tax offset of $60,000 under this section (the franking deficit offset) and a tax offset of $80,000 in respect of foreign income tax paid by the entity (the foreign income tax offset)._\n\n_Under section 63-10 (about tax offset priority rules), the foreign income tax offset must be applied before the franking deficit offset is applied. As a result, that offset and $20,000 of the franking deficit offset combine to reduce the entity’s income tax liability to nil.

An amount equal to the franking credit on the distribution ($60) is included in the partnership’s assessable income under section 207-35. Because the partnership has losses of $300 from other sources, it has a partnership loss of $100 for the income year._\n\n_The partnership has 2 equal partners. One partner is the trustee of a trust and the other partner is an individual. The distribution flows indirectly to each partner under subsection (2). Each partner has a share of the partnership loss ($50), a share of the distribution under sections 207-55 ($70) and a share of the franking credit under section 207-57 ($30)._\n\n_The individual partner is allowed a tax offset of $30 under section 207-45._\n\n_Because the trust has $100 of income from other sources, it has a net income of $50 for that income year ($100 minus the share of the partnership loss of $50)._\n\n_The trust has one individual as a beneficiary, to whom the distribution flows indirectly under subsection (3). The beneficiary’s share of the franked distribution is therefore $70 under sections 207-55 and its share of the franking credit is $30 under section 207-57. The beneficiary is also allowed a tax offset of $30 under section 207-45._",

This can happen because only income tax on income of a particular kind (capital gains on venture capital investments) gives rise to venture capital credits. This means that when a PDF anticipates a venture capital credit, it is not only anticipating that income tax will be paid, but that income tax on income of that kind will be paid. Although income tax may, in fact, later be paid, it will not necessarily be income of the kind that would give rise to a venture capital credit. This results in franking credits arising even while the venture capital sub-account remains in deficit.\n\n(3)\tThe discrepancy between the franking account balance and the venture capital sub-account balance can also arise because venture capital credits do not necessarily arise at the same time as the relevant franking credits and debits (see item 1 of the table in section 210-105 and item 2 of the table in section 210-120).",

The Commissioner might do this, for example, if the Commissioner wishes to audit the corporate tax entity’s franking activities over a number of years.\n\n(4)\tThe Commissioner may assess whether tax is payable under the imputation system and the amount of that tax.\n\n(5)\tIn most cases, this is done by treating the first franking return of a corporate tax entity for an income year as an assessment by the Commissioner. To this extent, there is self-assessment.\n\n(6)\tAn assessment by the Commissioner is conclusive evidence of a corporate tax entity’s tax liabilities under the imputation system, except for the purposes of objection, review and appeal processes under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (see section 350-10 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953).\n\n(7)\tAssessments can be amended by the Commissioner within certain time limits.",

                    "content_md": "*Revised shareholders’ ratio—modification of section 219-50*\n\n(1)\tSubsection (2) applies to a *life insurance company if a *tax offset under section 205-70 is applied to work out the company’s *income tax liability for an income year.\n\n_Note:\tThis means subsection (2) applies if the tax offset is applied to reduce the part of the company’s basic income tax liability mentioned in subsection 219-70(1) in relation to the income year._\n\n(2)\tFor the purposes of working out the amount of a *franking credit or *franking debit for the company in relation to the income year (other than a franking credit covered by item 1 of the table in section 219-15), section 219-50 has effect as if:\n\n(a)\tsteps 1 and 2 of the method statement in section 219-50 were omitted; and\n\n(b)\tthe reference in step 3 of that method statement to the *shareholders’ ratio were a reference to the revised shareholders’ ratio worked out as follows:\n\nMethod statement\n\nStep 1.\tWork out the remainder (if any) of the part of the company’s basic income tax liability mentioned in subsection 219-70(1) after the *tax offset is applied to reduce that part.\n\nNote:\tThe part mentioned in that subsection is the part of an amount of the company’s income tax liability for the income year that is attributable to its shareholders.\n\nStep 2.\tDivide the step 1 result by the company’s total *income tax liability for the income year (after applying the *tax offset).\n\nThe result (which can be nil) is the company’s revised shareholders’ ratio for the income year.\n\n_Example:\tFor the 2002-2003 income year X Co (which is a life insurance company) has a tax offset of $68,000 under section 205-70. Its income tax liability for that year would have been $400,000 on the assessment day (1 February 2004) if the tax offset were disregarded. Of that liability, $80,000 is attributable to the shareholders. The step 1 result is therefore $12,000 ($80,000 minus $68,000)._\n\n_X Co’s income tax liability after applying the tax offset is $332,000 ($400,000 minus $68,000). The revised shareholders’ ratio is therefore 3/83 ($12,000 divided by $332,000)._\n\n_For that income year, the company paid $249,000 of PAYG instalments before the assessment day and $83,000 of income tax one month after that day._\n\n_On the assessment day, a franking credit of $9,000 arises under item 2 of the table in section 219-15 ($249,000 multiplied by 3/83). On the day the additional amount of tax is paid, another franking credit of $3,000 arises under item 4 of that table ($83,000 multiplied by 3/83)._\n\n*Adjustment resulting from amended assessment—modification of section 219-55*\n\n(3)\tSubsection (4) applies to a *life insurance company if:\n\n(a)\tthe assessment of the company’s *income tax liability for an income year (the previous assessment) is amended; and\n\n(b)\tat least one of the following applies:\n\n(i)\ta *tax offset under section 205-70 is applied in making that amended assessment;\n\n(ii)\ta tax offset under section 205-70 was applied in making the previous assessment.\n\n(4)\tSection 219-55 has effect in relation to the company as if:\n\n(a)\tif subparagraph (3)(b)(i) of this section applies—a reference in that section to the new ratio were a reference to the revised shareholders’ ratio that is based on the amended assessment; and\n\n(b)\tif subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) of this section applies—the reference in paragraph (1)(b) of that section to the *shareholders’ ratio used previously were a reference to the revised shareholders’ ratio that is based on the previous assessment.\n\n_Example:\tContinuing the example in subsection (2), the assessment of X Co for the 2002-2003 income year is amended on 31 March 2004. Under the amended assessment, X Co’s income tax liability would be $300,000 if the tax offset were disregarded._\n\n_Of that liability, $60,000 is attributable to the shareholders. That amount is reduced by the tax offset of $68,000 to nil._\n\n_X Co’s liability to pay income tax is therefore reduced to $240,000 ($300,000 minus $60,000) and it will receive a refund of $92,000 ($332,000 minus $240,000). As the revised shareholders’ ratio has become nil, no franking debit arises from the refund._\n\n_The franking credits that previously arose from the payments of PAYG instalments and income tax would not have arisen if the new revised shareholders’ ratio had been used. Section 219-55 (as applied by subsection (4) of this section) therefore operates to create an adjustment to cancel those franking credits. The adjustment is a franking debit of $12,000 that arises on the day of the amendment of the assessment._",
