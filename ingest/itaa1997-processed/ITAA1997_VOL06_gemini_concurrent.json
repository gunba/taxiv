In particular, for the trust to be an AMIT, the interests of the members of the trust need to be clearly defined at all times during which the trust is in existence in the income year (see Subdivision 276-A).\n\nAn AMIT for an income year is treated as a fixed trust. A member of the AMIT in respect of the income year is treated as having a vested and indefeasible interest in a share of the income and capital of the AMIT throughout the income year (see Subdivision 276-B).\n\nAmounts related to income and tax offsets of an AMIT, determined by the trustee to be of a particular tax character, are attributed to members, generally retaining that tax character (see Subdivision 276-C).\n\nUnderestimates and overestimates of amounts at the trust level are carried forward and dealt with in later years. This is done on a character-by-character basis. An underestimate in an income year of a particular character results in an under of that character. An overestimate results in an over of that character. Unders and overs arise, and are dealt with, in the income year in which they are discovered (see Subdivision 276-F).\n\nThe trustee of an AMIT is liable to pay income tax on certain amounts reflecting under-attribution of income or over-attribution of tax offsets (see Subdivision 276-G).\n\nSpecial rules apply to a trust that ceases to be an AMIT (see Subdivision 276-K).",

*superannuation benefit that is a payment by the Commissioner under subsection 17(2), 20H(2), (2AA), (2A) or (3), 20QF(2), 21E(2), 22B(2), 24G(2) or 24NA(2) or (3) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999.\n\n*Element taxed in the fund*\n\n(2)\tWork out the element taxed in the fund as follows (unless subsection (3A) applies):\n\nMethod statement\n\nStep 1.\tWork out the amount (the unclaimed amount) (or amounts), set out in column 1 of the table in subsection (3), to which the *taxable component is attributable.\n\nNote:\tA payment made under subsection 17(2) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 1 or 2 of the table.\n\nA payment under subsection 20H(2) or (3) of that Act may be attributable to more than one unclaimed amount.\n\nA payment under subsection 20QF(2) of that Act is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 3A of the table.\n\nA payment under subsection 21E(2) of that Act is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 3B of the table.\n\nA payment under subsection 22B(2) of that Act is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 3C of the table.\n\nA payment made under subsection 24G(2) of that Act is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in item 4 of the table.\n\nA payment under subsection 24NA(2) or (3) of that Act may be attributable to more than one unclaimed amount.\n\nStep 2.\tAssume that the unclaimed amount (or each unclaimed amount), instead of being paid to the Commissioner, had been paid to the person as the payment (the claimed equivalent) set out in column 2 of the table.\n\nStep 3.\tThe element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component consists of so much of the taxable component as is attributable to the amount set out in column 3 of the table for the claimed equivalent (or as is attributable to the amounts set out in that column for the claimed equivalents).\n\n(3)\tThis is the table mentioned in subsection (2):\n\n\n| Element taxed in the fund | Element taxed in the fund | Element taxed in the fund | Element taxed in the fund |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Item | Column 1 Unclaimed amount | Column 2 Claimed equivalent | Column 3 Taxed element of claimed equivalent |\n| 1 | an amount paid, on or after 1 July 2007, to the Commissioner under subsection 17(1) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person | a *superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation plan | the *element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component of that superannuation benefit |\n| 2 | an amount paid, before 1 July 2007, to the Commissioner under subsection 17(1) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person | an eligible termination payment (within the meaning of subsection 27A(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as in force just before 1 July 2007) | the taxed element of the post-June 83 component of that eligible termination payment under Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as in force just before 1 July 2007 |\n| 3 | an amount paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person (other than an amount referred to in section 65AA of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992) | a *superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation plan | the *element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component of that superannuation benefit |\n| 3A | an amount paid to the Commissioner under section 20QD of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person | a *superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation plan | the *element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component of that superannuation benefit |\n| 3B | an amount paid to the Commissioner under section 21C of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person | a *superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation plan | the *element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component of that superannuation benefit |\n| 3C | an amount paid to the Commissioner under section 22 of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person | a *superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation plan | the *element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component of that superannuation benefit |\n| 4 | an amount paid to the Commissioner under section 24E of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 in respect of the person | a *superannuation benefit paid from a *superannuation plan | the *element taxed in the fund of the *taxable component of that superannuation benefit |\n\n_Note 1:\tSection 65AA of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 requires certain shortfall components to be treated as amounts paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999._\n\n_The effect of excluding such shortfall components from item 3 of the table in this subsection is that the element untaxed in the fund includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such a shortfall component._\n\n_Note 2:\tThe table in this subsection does not cover interest paid by the Commissioner under subsection 20H(2A) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999._\n\n_The effect of this is that the element untaxed in the fund of the taxable component includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such interest._\n\n(3A)\tThe element taxed in the fund is nil, if the *superannuation benefit is paid under subsection 20H(2AA) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 (interest).\n\n_Note:\tThe taxable component of a superannuation benefit paid by the Commissioner under subsection 17(2AB) or (2AC), 20QF(5) or (6), 21E(5) or (6), 22B(5) or (6) or 24G(3A) or (3B) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, or under subsection 20H(2AA) in respect of a person who is not a former temporary resident, is nil: see subsections 307-142(3B) and (4) of this Act._\n\n*Element untaxed in the fund*\n\n(4)\tThe element untaxed in the fund of the *taxable component is so much (if any) of the taxable component as is not the element taxed in the fund.",
