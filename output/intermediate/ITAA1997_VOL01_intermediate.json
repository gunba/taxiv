The result is the total assessable recoupment.\n\nStep 2.\tAdd up the amounts (if any) included in your assessable income for earlier income years, in respect of the loss or outgoing, by this section or a *previous recoupment law. The result is the recoupment already assessed. (If no amount was included, the recoupment already assessed is nil.)\n\nStep 3.\tSubtract the recoupment already assessed from the total assessable recoupment. The result is the unassessed recoupment.\n\nStep 4.\tAdd up each amount that you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the *current year, or you have deducted or can deduct for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year. The result is the total deductions for the loss or outgoing.\n\nNote:\tThe total deductions may be reduced if an amount has been included in your assessable income because of a balancing adjustment: see section 20-45.\n\nStep 5.\tSubtract the recoupment already assessed from the total deductions for the loss or outgoing. The result is the outstanding deductions.\n\nStep 6.\tThe unassessed recoupment is included in your assessable income, unless it is greater than the outstanding deductions. In that case, the amount of the outstanding deductions is included instead.\n\n_Example:\tAt the start of the 2002-03 income year, a company incurs $100,000 to start to hold a depreciating asset. The company uses the prime cost method, and the effective life is 10 years. $10,000 is deductible for the 2002-03 income year and for each of the following 9 income years under section 40-25._\n\n_In the 2002-03 income year, the company receives $20,000 as recoupment. How much is assessable for the 2002-03 income year?_\n\n_Applying the method statement:_\n\n_After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000._\n\n_After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil._\n\n_After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is: \ntotal assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,\ni.e. $20,000 minus 0 = $20,000._\n\n_After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000._\n\n_After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: \ntotal deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $10,000 minus 0 = $10,000._\n\n_After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $10,000._\n\n_Applying the method statement to the 2003-04 income year: a further $10,000 is included in the company’s assessable income._",

In the 2007-08 income year he incurs expenditure of $1,200 in contesting the election, of which he deducts $1,000 (the limit under subsection (1))._\n\n_In 2008-09, Chris receives $360 as an assessable recoupment of the expenditure. $300 of that is included in his assessable income by section 20-35 (as extended by section 20-50)._\n\n_Because of the assessable recoupment, $300 of the expenditure is disregarded under paragraph (2)(d) in applying the $1,000 limit. As a result, Chris’s deductions are treated as being only $700, which is less than the limit. This does not affect his original deduction for 2007-2008, but it means he can deduct the previously undeducted $200, for 2008-09 (see paragraph (2)(e))._\n\n_This triggers a further application of section 20-35 (as extended by section 20-50) to include the remaining $60 of the assessable recoupment in Chris’s assessable income for 2008-09. His total deductions (net of recoupment included in assessable income) come to $840, which is the same as his original expenditure (net of recoupment)._\n\n_Note:\tAn amount you receive as recoupment of expenditure may be included in your assessable income as an assessable recoupment under Subdivision 20-A, as ordinary income under section 6-5 or as statutory income under some other provision._",

In Year 1, Ian would be able to claim $100,000 in deductions for the boat (but for this subsection), including interest, depreciation and running costs. He earns only $40,000 of income from the boat. He can only deduct $40,000. He carries the remaining $60,000 forward to Year 2 (the quarantined amount)._\n\n_In Year 2, Ian has $95,000 of expenses and $30,000 of income for the boat. He can deduct $30,000. The quarantined amount is now $125,000: the quarantined amount from Year 1 plus the excess of expenses over income from Year 2._\n\n_In Year 3, Ian has $60,000 of expenses and $150,000 of income from the boat. The expenses from Year 3 plus the quarantined amount is $185,000. Therefore, Ian claims a deduction of $150,000 and carries forward $35,000 to Year 4._\n\n*Exception: business use*\n\n(3)\tThe rule in subsection (2) does not apply to amounts that are attributable to one or more of the following:\n\n(a)\t*holding a boat as your *trading stock;\n\n(b)\tusing a boat (or holding it) mainly for letting it on hire in the ordinary course of a *business that you carry on;\n\n(c)\tusing a boat (or holding it) mainly for transporting the public or goods for payment in the ordinary course of a business that you carry on;\n\n(d)\tusing a boat for a purpose that is essential to the efficient conduct of a business that you carry on.\n\n_Note:\tEven if this exception applies to you, you may still have to quarantine losses under Division 35 (deferral of losses from non-commercial business activities)._\n\n*Exception: fringe benefits*\n\n(4)\tThe rule in subsection (2) does not apply to so much of an amount you incur in *providing a *fringe benefit.\n\n*Modification if you have boat capital gains*\n\n(5)\tYou reduce a quarantined amount you have for an income year by so much of that amount as is applied under section 118-80 to reduce a *capital gain you have for the year in relation to a boat. You make this reduction before you deduct an amount under subsection (6).\n\n*Deduction if you have boat business profits*\n\n(6)\tYou can deduct all or part of your remaining quarantined amount for an income year if your assessable income for the year from activities of a kind referred to in subsection (3) exceeds your deductions for the year relating to those activities. The amount you can deduct is the lesser of that excess and that remaining quarantined amount.\n\n(7)\tYou reduce your quarantined amount for the year by the amount you deduct. You make this reduction before a reduction under subsection (8).\n\n*Modification if you have exempt income*\n\n(8)\tYou reduce any remaining quarantined amount you have for an income year by your *net exempt income for that year (after *utilising the net exempt income under section 35-15 (about non-commercial business activities) or section 36-10 or 36-15 (about tax losses)).\n\n*Modification if you become bankrupt*\n\n(9)\tThe modification in subsection (10) has effect if:\n\n(a)\tin an income year (the current year) you become bankrupt or are released from a debt by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy; or\n\n(b)\tyou became bankrupt before the current year and:\n\n(i)\tthe bankruptcy is annulled in the current year under section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 because your creditors have accepted a proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and\n\n(ii)\tunder the composition or scheme of arrangement, you have been, will be or may be released from some or all of the debts from which you would have been released if you had instead been discharged from the bankruptcy.\n\n(10)\tThis Act applies to you as if any amount that:\n\n(a)\tis a quarantined amount for you for the current year or was a quarantined amount for you for an earlier year; and\n\n(b)\thas not been applied under section 118-80 and that you have not yet deducted;\n\nwere not an amount relating to using or holding boats that you can deduct for the current year or a later year.",

You need to look at the table to see whether the type of gift or contribution you are making is covered by it.\n\n(3)\tIn some cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-B. It has a number of tables that list particular funds, authorities or institutions that deductible gifts can be made to.\n\n(4)\tIn other cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-C. It contains rules that apply to particular gifts of property.\n\n(4AA)\tSubdivision 30-BA provides for the Commissioner to endorse as a deductible gift recipient an entity that is, or operates, a fund, authority or institution. The relevance of the Subdivision to you is that generally you can deduct only a gift you make to a recipient that is endorsed or named in:\n\n(a)\tthis Division; or\n\n(b)\tregulations made for the purposes of this Division.\n\n_Note:\tThe fact that gifts to a recipient registered in the Australian Business Register are deductible will be shown in the Register._\n\n(4AB)\tSubdivision 30-CA sets out administrative rules which do not directly affect whether you can deduct a gift you make. The rules require:\n\n(a)\ta receipt issued by an entity for a gift to the entity or to a fund, authority or institution operated by the entity to show the entity’s ABN; and\n\n(b)\tthe Australian Business Registrar to enter in the Australian Business Register a statement in relation to an entity entered in the Register if:\n\n(i)\tgifts to the entity are deductible; or\n\n(ii)\tgifts to a fund, authority or institution operated by the entity are deductible.\n\n(4B)\tSubdivision 30-DB allows you to spread deductions for certain gifts and covenants over up to 5 income years.",

Division 67 sets out which tax offsets are subject to the refundable tax offset rules._\n\n_Example:\tFor the 2017-18 income year, Company E (which is not a base rate entity) has:_\n\n                assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $140 and franking credit of $60); and\n\n                $100 of deductions that are allowable.\n\n_The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules._\n\n_Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30:_\n\n\n[Image Description: Start formula open bracket open bracket $140 plus $60 close bracket minus $100 close bracket times 30% end formula]\n\n_This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that year._\n\n*How to work out the amount of the tax loss*\n\n(2)\tFor the purposes of this Act, if:\n\n(a)\tan entity has an amount of *excess franking offsets for an income year; and\n\n(b)\tthe result of applying the following method statement is a positive amount;\n\nthen:\n\n(c)\tthe entity is taken to have a *tax loss for that year equal to that positive amount (instead of an amount of tax loss worked out under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30); and\n\n(d)\tthat year is taken to be a *loss year for the entity if the entity would not otherwise have a tax loss for that year.\n\nMethod statement\n\nStep 1.\tWork out the amount (if any) that would have been the entity’s *tax loss for that year under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30 if the entity’s *net exempt income for that year (if any) were disregarded.\n\nNote:\tSee section 36-20 for the calculation of net exempt income.\n\nStep 2.\tDivide the amount of *excess franking offsets by the entity’s *corporate tax rate for imputation purposes for that year.\n\nStep 3.\tAdd the results of steps 1 and 2.\n\nStep 4.\tReduce the result of step 3 by the entity’s *net exempt income for that year (if any).\n\nThe result of this step is taken to be the entity’s *tax loss for that year. However, if the result of this step is nil or a negative amount, the company does not have any tax loss for that year.\n\n_Example:\tAssume that company E did not derive any exempt income for the 2017-2018 income year and that it would not otherwise have any tax loss for that year under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30._\n\n_Applying the method statement, the amount of excess franking offsets of $30 generates a tax loss of $100 for that year, which can be deducted in a later income year under section 36-15 or 36-17._",
