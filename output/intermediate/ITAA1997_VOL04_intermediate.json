The share provides Philip with the right to receive dividends, to participate in the running of the company and to have a separate contractual agreement with Big Pump Irrigation Ltd for the delivery of 1 megalitre of water. Philip has such an agreement. Philip’s agreement is a water entitlement. Philip’s share is also a water entitlement because he must own the share in order to have a contractual arrangement with Big Pump Irrigation Ltd for the delivery of water._",

For example, the 15-year exemption applies only if you have held the CGT asset for at least 15 years and you retire.\n\nThere are limitations on the availability of the small business concessions for CGT events J2, J5 and J6.\n\nYou do not need to satisfy the basic conditions for the retirement exemption in relation to CGT events J5 and J6.",

This loss was fully reflected in the market value of shares in Beta Co._\n\n_Alpha Co and Gamma Co are not associated in any way._\n\n_Result:_\n\n_Step 1:\tAn alteration time occurred in respect of Beta Co as a result of the change in ownership that occurred when Alpha Co sold its shares._\n\n_Step 2:\tBeta Co was a loss company at the alteration time because it had an unapplied net capital loss from an earlier income year._\n\n_Step 3:\tAlpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co immediately before the alteration time because it had a controlling stake and significant interest (80% equity interest). Gamma Co did not have a relevant equity interest in Beta Co because it did not have a controlling stake._\n\n_Step 4:\tBecause Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co, the reduced cost bases of its shares in Beta Co are reduced by 80% of Beta Co’s net capital loss:_\n\n\n[Image Description: Start formula 80% times $500 equals $400 end formula]\n\n_Alpha Co does not make a capital gain on the disposal of its shares in Beta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are less than the cost bases ($1,000)._\n\n_Nor did Alpha Co make a capital loss on the disposal of its shares in Beta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are not less than the reduced cost bases as further reduced by this Subdivision ($600)._\n\n_The net capital loss in Beta Co is not duplicated on the sale of Alpha Co’s shares in Beta Co._\n\n_Step 5.\tThere are no notice requirements in this simple case. If Gamma Co and Alpha Co were associates (so that Gamma Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co), Alpha Co would need to provide the following information to Gamma Co:_\n\n_(a)\tthe alteration time: 6 February 2000;_\n\n_(b)\tBeta Co’s overall loss at the alteration time: $500;_\n\n_(c)\tdetails of the overall loss: a net capital loss of $500 for the 1998-99 income year._",
