If the market value of the property is $180 million but the cash payment is only $50 million, there is a net shift of value from company A to company B of $130 million._\n\n(2)\tIt is called indirect because the transaction will have the indirect effect of shifting value from equity or loan interests in the losing entity to equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.\n\nThis is because the net shift in value between the entities will usually decrease the market value of interests in the losing entity and increase the market value of interests in the gaining entity.\n\n_Example:\tAssume that company C owns all the shares in company A and company D owns all the shares in company B. The net shift of value from company A to company B will reduce the value of company C’s shares in company A and increase the value of company D’s shares in company B._\n\n(3)\tIt will also produce corresponding effects further up a chain of entities.\n\n_Example:\tAssume that company E owns all the shares in company C and company D. The net shift of value from company A to company B will also reduce the value of company E’s shares in company C and increase the value of its shares in company D._\n\n\n[Image Description: Squares labelled E, C, D, A and B with downward arrows indicating the relationship between companies E, C and A and companies E, D and B for the purpose of net shift of value]\n\n(4)\tThis Division is not concerned with the tax treatment of the net shift in value between the entities at the bottom of the chains. Instead, it deals with the effects on the market value of interests (both direct and indirect) in those entities.\n\n(5)\tAn indirect value shift distorts the relationship between the market value of an equity or loan interest and its value for income tax purposes. When the interest is realised, this can produce an inappropriate loss for income tax purposes, or an inappropriate gain.\n\n_Example:\tIf company E sold its shares in company C, the indirect value shift could (apart from this Division) result in a loss for income tax purposes. Company E could defer the corresponding gain on its shares in company D by not selling these._",

TRR Limited also has permanent establishments in Malaysia. TRR Limited has statement worldwide debt of $90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30 million. The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $100 million (which is the result of step 7 of the method statement in subsection 820-100(2)) equals $75 million. The zero capital amount is $5 million. Adding that amount to $75 million results in $80 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $80 million._",

The result of this step is the average value.\n\n_Example:\tKJW Finance Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity, held assets valued at $130 million on the first day of an income year. On the last day of each quarterly period for that year it held assets valued at $140 million, $120 million, $110 million and $100 million respectively. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 5 gives the average value of its assets for that year, which is $120 million._\n\n*Quarterly period*\n\n(3)\tThe quarterly periods of the income year are:\n\n(a)\tthe period consisting of the first, second and third months of that year; and\n\n(b)\teach successive period of 3 months that occurs after that period during that year.\n\n(4)\tThis is the method statement for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b):\n\nMethod statement\n\nStep 1.\tWork out the value of the particular matter as at each of the following measurement days:\n\n(a)\tthe first day of the measurement period;\n\n(b)\tthe last day of each regular interval for the measurement period (see subsection (5));\n\n(c)\tthe last day of the measurement period if it is not a day mentioned in paragraph (b).\n\nStep 2.\tAdd up those values.\n\nStep 3.\tDivide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement days. The result of this step is the average value.\n\n_Example:\tTW Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity, adopts a weekly interval for the purposes of this subsection. The measurement period is a period of 12 weeks. On the first day of that period it had $70 million of debt capital. Its debt capital was $80 million on the last day of each of the first 7 weeks, and $95 million on the last day of the remaining 5 weeks. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 13 (the number of measurement days) gives the average value of its debt capital for that period, which is $85 million._\n\n*Regular intervals*\n\n(5)\tThe regular intervals for the measurement period are:\n\n(a)\ta period which consists of a fixed number of days or months (not less than one day and not more than 3 months) adopted by the entity and begins at the start of the first day of the measurement period; and\n\n(b)\teach successive period of the same duration that occurs during the measurement period.\n\n_Note:\tExamples of a regular interval therefore include a daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly or quarterly interval._\n\n(6)\tThe entity must use the same regular intervals when calculating the average values of different matters under subsection (4) for that period.",
