Paragraph (3)(a) has effect subject to this subsection.\n\n_Note:\tThis means that things that happen in relation to the entity at the time it becomes a subsidiary member of the group are taken into account in determining whether the entity can utilise such a loss to affect its taxable income for the non-membership period._\n\n*Income tax for the financial year*\n\n(4)\tThe entity’s income tax (if any) for the *financial year concerned is the total of every amount of income tax worked out for the entity under subsection (3).\n\n*Taxable income for the income year*\n\n(5)\tThe entity’s taxable income for the income year is the total of every amount of taxable income worked out for the entity under subsection (3).\n\n(6)\tThe entity’s income tax worked out under subsection (4) is taken to be payable on the entity’s taxable income for the income year worked out under subsection (5), even if the amount of the tax differs from the amount that would be worked out by reference to that taxable income apart from subsection (5).\n\n*Loss for the income year*\n\n(7)\tThe entity has a loss of a particular *sort for the income year if and only if it has a non-membership period loss of that sort for the non-membership period (if any) ending at the end of the income year.

Section 719-325 provides for a choice to cancel all losses in certain bundles of losses. A choice under one of those sections may result in a bundle not coming into existence, or not being in existence after a certain time._\n\n(6)\tTo avoid doubt, a choice under section 707-145 or 719-325, as it operates because of subsection (5) of this section, relating to the loss does not affect or prevent:\n\n(a)\ta transfer of the loss that would have occurred under Subdivision 707-A as described in another application of that subsection involving a different company; or\n\n(b)\t*utilisation of the loss by the company that actually made the loss and is different from the company assumed under Division 170 to have made the loss.\n\n_Note:\tTherefore a choice under section 707-145 or 719-325, as operating because of subsection (5) of this section, will be able to cause only one bundle not to exist, and will not affect the existence of other bundles that are treated as existing because of other operations of that subsection._",

Section 701-5 (Entry history rule) treats the head company as having incurred the expenditure that was allocated to the pool._\n\n_Note 2:\tSection 701-10 provides that, for each asset the joining entity has at the joining time, the asset’s tax cost is set at the joining time at the asset’s tax cost setting amount, which is defined by section 701-60 as the amount worked out under Division 705, which in turn depends on the adjustable value of the asset worked out under section 40-85._\n\n_Note 3:\tSection 701-55 affects matters relevant to working out the head company’s deductions for the decline in value of depreciating assets that became assets of the head company at the joining time because section 701-1 (Single entity rule) applied to the joining entity._\n\n_Note 4:\tThis section operates whether or not the joining entity’s deductions under section 40-455 for the period before the joining time for expenditure allocated to the pool total 100% of the expenditure allocated to the pool._\n\n*Object*\n\n(2)\tThe main object of this section is to ensure that:\n\n(a)\tthe *head company’s deductions for the *in-house software:\n\n(i)\tare not worked out under section 40-455 on the basis of section 701-5 (Entry history rule) treating the expenditure relating to the software as being the head company’s expenditure; and\n\n(ii)\tare instead worked out under Subdivision 40-B, using the *prime cost method with the *effective life given by subsection 40-95(7) and taking account of the *tax cost setting amount for the software; and\n\n(b)\tthe tax cost setting amount is worked out in a way that takes account of deductions for the period before the joining time for the expenditure reasonably related to the in-house software.\n\n*Joining entity taken not to have incurred certain expenditure*\n\n(3)\tSubdivision 40-B and section 40-455 operate for the head company core purposes mentioned in section 701-1 (Single entity rule) as if the expenditure reasonably related to the *in-house software had not been incurred by the joining entity.\n\n_Note 1:\tThis has the effects that:_\n\n_(a)\tsubsection 40-50(2) does not apply because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule) to deny the head company deductions under Subdivision 40-B for the decline in value of the software; and_\n\n_(b)\tthe head company cannot deduct the expenditure under section 40-455 as it operates because of section 701-5._\n\n_Note 2:\tThis does not prevent the head company from deducting under section 40-455 expenditure that is not reasonably related to the in-house software and that the head company is treated by section 701-5 as having incurred and allocated to a software development pool because the joining entity did._\n\n*Prime cost method of working out decline in value of software*\n\n(4)\tSubsection 701-55(2) operates as if the *prime cost method of working out the decline in value of the *in-house software applied just before the joining time.\n\n_Note:\tThis affects the method of working out the decline in value of the software for the head company of the consolidated group._\n\n*Effective life of software*\n\n(5)\tSubdivision 40-B operates as if the *effective life of the *in-house software were the period specified for in-house software in subsection 40-95(7). Subsection 701-55(2) is subject to this subsection.\n\n*Cost of in-house software*\n\n(6)\tSections 701-10 and 701-60 and Division 705 (and section 40-85, so far as it affects that Division) operate as if the *cost of the *in-house software were the total amount of the joining entity’s expenditure that reasonably related to the software and was allocated to a software development pool.\n\n*Earlier decline in value of the in-house software*\n\n(7)\tSections 701-10 and 701-60 and Division 705 (and section 40-85, so far as it affects that Division) operate as if the decline in value, and deductions for the decline in value, of the *in-house software for a period before the joining time were the amount worked out under subsection (8).\n\n(8)\tWork out the amount by:\n\n(a)\tworking out, for each software development pool to which expenditure relating to the *in-house software was allocated, the amount of the joining entity’s deductions under section 40-455 that reasonably relates to the software; and\n\n(b)\tadding up each of those amounts if there are 2 or more such pools.\n\n_Note:\tSubsections (6), (7) and (8) can affect the working out of the tax cost setting amount for the in-house software, by affecting the joining entity’s terminating value for the software, which section 705-30 defines as being the adjustable value of the software just before the joining time, and which is relevant to sections 705-40 and 705-57 (which may reduce the tax cost setting amount for the software)._",

For example:_\n\n_(a)\tprovisions operating if the head company holds (whether directly or indirectly) membership interests in another entity operate even if an eligible tier-1 company actually holds those interests; and_\n\n_(b)\tprovisions operating if the head company owns or controls another entity operate even if one or more eligible tier-1 companies actually own or control that other entity; and_\n\n_(c)\tprovisions operating if an entity is interposed between the head company and another entity operate even if the first entity is actually interposed between an eligible tier-1 company and the other entity._\n\n_Note 2:\tIf the MEC joining entity is an eligible tier-1 company, this subsection means the assets of the entity do not have their tax cost reset at the MEC joining time.

That test applies to the head company (and not the test company)._\n\n_Note 2:\tSection 719-285 may affect whether the head company satisfies the business continuity test if there has been a change in the identity of the head company of the group during the ownership test period._\n\n*Business continuity test for head company under Division 166*\n\n(4)\tIf section 166-40 directly affects whether the *head company can deduct the debt, the subsection of that section that requires the *business continuity test to be applied to a particular *business operates as if it required that test to be applied to the business the head company carried on just before the time described in subsection (3) of this section.\n\n_Note:\tSection 166-40 has an indirect effect on whether the head company can deduct the debt so far as that section affects whether the test company meets the conditions in section 165-123 and therefore whether the head company is taken to meet those conditions._",

For example, the Commissioner may take proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the TSA liability, proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the linked group liability, or both.\n\n_Note:\tThe TSA contributing member will not be jointly and severally liable for the linked group liability under section 721-15 (see subsection 721-15(3)). However, the head company of the group remains liable for the linked group liability._\n\n*Payment or discharge of TSA liability*\n\n(2)\tIf an amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards discharging the TSA liability, the linked group liability is discharged at that time to the extent of the same amount.\n\n*Payment or discharge of linked group liability*\n\n(3)\tIf:\n\n(a)\tan amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards discharging the linked group liability; and\n\n(b)\tas a result, the amount unpaid on the TSA liability at that time (apart from this section) exceeds the amount unpaid on the linked group liability at that time;\n\nthe TSA liability is discharged at that time to the extent of the excess.\n\n(4)\tSubsections (2) and (3) operate in relation to a liability under a judgment (the judgment liability):\n\n(a)\tif the judgment liability is for the entire amount unpaid on the TSA liability—as if the judgment liability were the TSA liability; and\n\n(b)\tif the judgment liability is for the entire amount unpaid on the linked group liability—as if the judgment liability were the linked group liability.\n\n(5)\tThis section does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.",
