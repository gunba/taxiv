## MCP Changelog (fastmcp / mcp_server)

Use this file for changes primarily affecting the MCP server (`mcp_server/`) and its integration with the backend API surface.

2025-11-15 - No MCP-specific changes in this cleanup; existing MCP tooling continues to target /api/search/unified and /api/provisions/detail/{internal_id} against the reorganized backend.
