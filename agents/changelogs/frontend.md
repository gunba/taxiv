## Frontend Changelog (React/Vite)

Use this file for changes primarily affecting the frontend (`frontend/` and `tests/frontend/`), including UI, TypeScript, and Vitest suites.

2025-11-15 - Centralized frontend tests under tests/frontend/**, aligned Vitest config and TypeScript paths with the new structure, moved the Taxiv logo into frontend/assets, renamed the entrypoint to main.tsx, and confirmed the localhost:3000 UI works against the updated backend config.
2025-11-15 - Simplified README.md into a user-facing overview (what Taxiv is, how to run it, how to ingest data, and how to run tests) and moved UI/search/SideNav/MCP implementation details into the agents guides.
