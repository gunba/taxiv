# General Best Practices

* Use tab for indenting, as it reduces filesize and token use.
* Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Ensure code is secure and safe, as this code is open-source and drives a public facing product.
* Do not add excessive error handling for improbable cases.
